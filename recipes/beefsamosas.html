    <h2>The best beef Samosas</h2>
    <p>Samosa is a triangular-shape savory pastry fried in oil, containing spiced vegetables, ground beef/lamb, ground
        chicken or fish. In the Kenyan Cuisine, samosas are considered as exotic snacks of all times. Below is a simple
        recipe for ground beef samosas which are my favorites! Enjoy!.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>1 cup peas, drained</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons oil, for frying</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf, crushed</li>
        <li>2 large onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black peppe</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground Coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped green chile peppers</li>
        <li>1 quart oil, for deep frying</li>
        <li>1 package (16 ounce size) phyllo dough</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a medium saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Stir in potatoes and peas. Cook until potatoes
            are tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, mash together and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large saucepan over medium high heat, heat the oil. Brown cumin seeds and bay leaf. Mix in onions and
            ground beef. Cook until beef is evenly brown and onions are soft, about 5 minutes. Mix in garlic, fresh
            ginger root. Season with black pepper, salt, cumin, coriander, turmeric, chili powder, cinnamon and
            cardamom. Stir in the mashed potato mixture.
        </li>
        <li>Remove from heat and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour, or until cool.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large, heavy saucepan over high heat. Mix cilantro and green chile peppers into the potato and
            beef mixture. Place approximately 1 tablespoon of the mixture onto each phyllo sheet. Fold sheets into
            triangles, pressing edges together with moistened fingers.</li>
        <li>In small batches, fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve warm.</li>
