    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour plus a little more flour for kneading</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon Salt</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons oil</li>
        <li>1¼ Cups Water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, and oil in a bowl and mix thoroughly. Add the water a little at a time
            to form a soft and sticky dough.</li>
        <li>Turn to a floured surface; knead for about 10 to 15 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Place in a
            bowl. Cover and let it rest in a warm place for about 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide the dough into 8 equal parts and roll each piece into a circle.
            You can roll out the dough into a circle cook the Chapatis at this point. However, if you want a flaky and
            well-layered chapati, move on with the rest of the steps below.</li>
        <li>Lightly brush the rolled out chapati with some Oil and roll it as you would roll up a mat. At this point, it
            should be like a rope then roll the ”rope-like” to form a coil then pull the tip towards the center of the
            coil and tuck in using your index finger then cover it up with a damp towel and leave it to rest for about
            10 to 15 minutes. (Please refer to image above)</li>
        <li>Flour your work surface again and start rolling out each of the coiled dough to about 1/8th thickness (the
            dough will eventually shrink up to about 1-2/4 inch thickness).</li>
        <li>Preheat a non-stick pan or a heavy bottom skillet. Place the chapati on inside the pan and leave it to cook
            for a few seconds before disturbing it. </li>
        <li>Brush the surface of the chapati with a very thin layer of oil. Once you begin to see bubbles rise on top of
            the chapati, flip it over to the other side and brush it also with a thin layer of Oil</li>
        <li>Continue to flip over about one or two more times until you achieve your desired brownness. Serve hot or
            warm and enjoy with your favorite dish.</li>
